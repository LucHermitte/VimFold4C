VimFold4C
=========

Reactive vim fold plugin for C &amp; C++ (and similar languages).

Unlike folding on syntax or on indent, this script tries to correctly detect
the fold boundaries.

## Features

The foldtext displayed will also try to be as pertinent as possible:
- Correctly indented
- Strip spaces in parenthesis
- Strip `scopes::` (optional)
- Multiple subsequent (consecutive ?) `#include` will be condensed into one line
- `#if` & co are folded
- When the fold text line to display is too long, simplifications are operated:
    - Template parameters may be discarded
    - Initialisation-lists are replaced with  `....`
    - Parameter names are discarded (this requires [lh-cpp](https://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-cpp)).
    - Last parameters are discarded 
- fold any instruction, or declaration, spanning on several lines (`cout`,
  `printf`, `log(stuff << stuff)`


## Note
In order to keep the plugin reactive, I had to introduce a few hacks that
diminish the precision of the incremental algorithm used to detect fold
boundaries.  
As a consequence, sometimes lines are folded in a very strange way.  
In order to fix it, use `zx` or `zX` to reset all fold boundaries.

## Demo

Here is a little screencast to see how things are displayed with VimFold4C.

Note: the code comes from unrelated
[experiment of mine](https://github.com/LucHermitte/NamedParameter).

## Options

### How to set them (syntax)

You can set local or global options to tune the behaviour of this fold-plugin.
```vim
" In the .vimrc
let g:fold_options = {
   \ 'fold_blank': 0,
   \ 'fold_includes': 0,
   \ 'max_foldline_length': 'win',
   \ 'merge_comments' : 1,
   \ 'show_if_and_else': 1,
   \ 'strip_namespaces': 1,
   \ 'strip_template_arguments': 1
   \ }
```
or from a [local_vimrc plugin](https://github.com/LucHermitte/local_vimrc):
```vim
let b:fold_options = {
   \ 'fold_blank': 1,
   \ 'fold_includes': 1,
   \ 'ignored_doxygen_fields': ['class', 'ingroup', 'function', 'def', 'defgroup', 'exception', 'headerfile', 'namespace', 'property', 'fn', 'var'],
   \ 'max_foldline_length': 'win',
   \ 'merge_comments' : 0,
   \ 'show_if_and_else': 1,
   \ 'strip_namespaces': 1,
   \ 'strip_template_arguments': 1
   \ }

```

### Available options
The
[options](https://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-vim-lib/blob/master/doc/Options.md) are:

- `fold_blank` (default: _true_) tells to fold blanks lines with the lines
  preceding them.

- `fold_includes` (default: _true_) tells to fold blocks of `#include` directives.

- `ignored_doxygen_fields` (default: `['class', 'ingroup', 'function', 'def',
  'defgroup', 'exception', 'headerfile', 'namespace', 'property', 'fn',
  'var']`) list of doxygen keywords that shall be ignored when computing the
  folded text -- when `merge_comments == 0`

- `max_foldline_length` (default: _"win"_) specifies the maximum line length
  of the fold text. The possibile values are: 
  - _"win"_: stops at current window width
  - _"tw"_: stops at current [`'textwidth'`](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/options.txt.html#%27tw%27) column
  - number: hardcoded maximum number of characters to keep.

- `merge_comments` (default: 1) specifies whether comments shall be folded
  together with the code or separativelly.

- `strip_namespaces` (default: _true_) tells to strip scopes like `std::` or
  `boost::filesystem::` from the fold text generated.

- `strip_template_arguments` (default: _true_) strips template arguments from
  the fold text generated if the text would be too long for the current window
  width

- `show_if_and_else` (which is currently hard-coded to _true_) requires to have
  two folds on

    ```c
    if (foo) {
        foo_action();
    } else {
        bar_action();
    }
    ```

    instead of the single fold we have when using `indent` _foldmethod_ (or was it
    the `syntax` one ?).

## Requirements / Installation

  * Requirements: Vim 7.+, [lh-vim-lib](http://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-vim-lib) 4.2.0+

  * With [vim-addon-manager](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager), install VimFold4C.

    ```vim
    ActivateAddons VimFold4C
    ```

  * or with [vim-flavor](http://github.com/kana/vim-flavor) which also supports
    dependencies:

    ```
    flavor 'LucHermitte/VimFold4C'
    ```

  * When installing [lh-cpp](http://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-cpp) with
    [vim-addon-manager](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager), or
    other plugin managers based on
    [vim-pi](https://bitbucket.org/vimcommunity/vim-pi), or with
    [vim-flavor](http://github.com/kana/vim-flavor) this fold-plugin will get
    automatically installed.

    ```vim
    ActivateAddons lh-cpp
    " Or just this one (and soon as I register it in vim-pi):
    ActivateAddons VimFold4C
    ```

    This is the preferred method because of the various dependencies, and
    because VimFold4C will do a better job if lh-cpp is installed and detected.

  * or with Vundle/NeoBundle (expecting I haven't forgotten anything):

    ```vim
    Bundle 'LucHermitte/lh-vim-lib'
    Bundle 'LucHermitte/VimFold4C'
    ```

So far, it is only triggered for C and C++. It should be easy to use it from
C#, Java, and other languages with C like syntax: a

```vim
runtime ftplugin/c/c-fold.vim
```

from a C#/Java/... ftplugin should do the trick.

However, I'm unlikely to handle specials cases in those languages.

## TO DO
There is still a lot to be done:

- [optional] Fold visibilities
- `#include`
  - [optional] cut the foldtext line when it's too long to fit
  - [optional] strip the dirname of each included file to build the foldtext
    line.
- Comments
  - Correctly handle comments for fold boundaries detection
  - [optional] when there is a leading comment, add a summary at the end of the
    fold text
  - [optional] support a policy for comments handling (integrated to the
    following fold, independent fold, not folded)
  - use @doxygen tags to build comments foldtext
  - File headers shall have a special treatment -> detect
    copyrights/licence/... to build the foldtext
- Tests
  - Test, Test, and re-test!
  - Test with C++11 lambdas
- Control statements
  - `switch`/`case`
    - increment foldlevel for every `case`
    - [optional] merge `case`s that aren't separated by a `break;`
  - `do { } while();` requires a specific handling

## History
- A long time ago (~2001), Johannes Zellner published a first folding plugin
  for C & C++.
- Then, I did some changes (2002-2004), but the result was very slow at the
  time. (the last version is still archived in
  <http://hermitte.free.fr/vim/ressources/lh-cpp.tar.gz>)
- Eventually I got tired of the slow execution times and moved back to
  `foldmethod=indent`.

- Here is a new (2014) version almost entirely rewritten, that I hope will
  be fast enough to be usable.
